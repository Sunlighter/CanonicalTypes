# CanonicalTypes
A C# canonical types library.

Requires Microsoft's [Immutable Collections](http://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Collections.Immutable).

This is my own private alternative to JSON. It is inspired by Scheme S-expressions. It supports a wide
variety of data types.

It is currently a work in progress.
